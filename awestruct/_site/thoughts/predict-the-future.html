          <p>The ability to predict the future is an art. An art that can be learned. Culturally we teach children at a young age that predicting the future is make believe and anyone who says that they can predict the future is silly and is probably a con artist.</p>
          <p>Take a moment to think about what it actually means to predict the future. To some degree everyone is expected to be able to. If you put your finger on a stove top it is safe to assume that in the near future there will be a burnt finger.</p>
          <p>How about a harder one. What will person x think, act, say and do when you say what you are going to say next? &quot;What about free will?&quot; I hear you say, &quot;Of course there is no way to predict the future here.&quot; Hmmmm. What if your life depended on it? You could. In this case &quot;predict the future&quot; just means figure out the things that will happen more often than not.</p>
          <p>Now comes the really tricky part. Sometimes by trying to predict the future it ends up altering what would have happened. Imagine the following scenarios where you are having a conversation about something important the person you are talking with may do soon:</p>
          <p><strong>No predicting the future. Just say whatever comes to mind.</strong></p>
          <p>Whatever was going to happen happens.</p>
          <p><strong>Predict the future and say whatever you were going to say.</strong></p>
          <p>Your body language is not going to say the same thing as it would have had you not predicted the future. There is a chance that something different will happen.</p>
          <p><strong>Predict the future and flat out say what your prediction is.</strong></p>
          <ul>
          <li>The person entirely disregards what you said and does whatever they were going to anyway.</li>
          <li>The person takes your prediction as a challenge (consciously or otherwise) and tilts the future out of favor of whatever you predicted.</li>
          <li>The person thinks about it, agrees that maybe the outcome will be as you predicted (consciously or otherwise) and tilts the future in favor of whatever you predicted.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Predict the future and attempt to subtly guide the future towards what you think is better.</strong></p>
          <p>The results of this are the same as flat out saying it. However they are harder to measure.</p>
          <!-- Self fulfilling prophecies -->
          <p>There is a choice every person can make. Either: 1) Assume the burden of investing time and energy in an attempt to guide the future. Or: 2) Invest no effort at all and let whatever happens happen. Which is better under which circumstances?</p>
