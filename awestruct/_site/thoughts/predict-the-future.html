          <p>The ability to predict the future is an art. An art that can be learned. Culturally we teach children at a young age that predicting the future is make believe and anyone who says that they can predict the future is silly and is probably a con artist.</p>
          
          <p>Take a moment to think about what it actually means to predict the future. To some degree everyone is expected to be able to predict the future. If you put your finger on a stove top it is safe to assume that in the near future there will be a burnt finger.</p>
          
          <p>How about a harder one. What will happen if you do poorly in school? The future looks a little dimmer. Where does this belief come from? It is so according to the elders. However the reality in situations like this is fairly vague. A large chunk of this future is left entirely up to chance. Chance flies in the face of the written-in-stone style of predictions you may hear. For example, "It will be hard to find a good job." A better way for elders to help a student is to identify and rank What Will Happen If scenarios. What will happen if the student attends a trade school? What will happen if the student attends a university and graduates with mediocre grades as well? What will happen if the student gets a job after university that pays very, very well despite their mediocre grades? What if the student's job consumes his or her life and he or she ends up dying lonely and pessimistic? What are all of the possible things that could happen and what are their consequences? Now which ones are likely enough to be worth mentioning? Telling a student what to do with their life is probably not going to have a good effect. Enable the student to decide rather than to trying to guide the student.</p>
          
          <p>How about a harder one. What will person x think, act, say and do when you say what you are going to say next? "What about free will?" I hear you say. "Of course there is no way to predict the future here." Hmmmm. What if your life depended on it? You could. In this case "predict the future" just means figure out the things that will happen more often than not.</p>
          
          <p>Now comes the really tricky part. Sometimes by trying to predict the future it ends up altering what would have happened. Imagine the following scenarios where you are having a conversation with someone about something important that they may do soon:</p>
          
          <p><strong>No predicting the future. Just say whatever comes to mind.</strong></p>
          
          <p>Whatever was going to happen happens.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Predict the future and say whatever you were going to say.</strong></p>
          
          <p>Your body language is not going to say the same thing as it would have had you not predicted the future. There is a chance that something different will happen.</p>
          
          <p><strong>Predict the future and flat out say what your prediction is.</strong></p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>The person entirely disregards what you said and does whatever they were going to anyway.</li>
            <li>The person takes your prediction as a challenge (consciously or otherwise) and tilts the future out of favor of whatever you predicted.</li>
            <li>The person thinks about it, agrees that maybe the outcome will be as you predicted (consciously or otherwise) and tilts the future in favor of whatever you predicted.</li>
          </ul>
          
          <p><strong>Predict the future and attempt to subtly guide the future towards what you think is better.</strong></p>
          
          <p>The results of this are the same as flat out saying it. However they are harder to measure.</p>
          
          <!-- Self fulfilling prophecies -->
          
          <p>There is a choice every person has to make. Either: 1) Assume the burden of investing countless time and energy in an attempt to guide the future as well as possible. Or: 2) Invest no effort at all and let whatever happens happen. Which is better under which circumstances?</p>
