          <p>It seems seriously unlikely that you are actually right when so many other people think that you are wrong. After running through every possible avenue attempting to prove yourself wrong and failing completely, it's time to face the truth: you are right and everyone else is wrong. This is the least ideal situation possible. Now, not only do you have to solve a problem, you have to solve it alone, AND everyone else is in your way. Sometimes even actively working against you. This is the point where you have to ask yourself a philosophical question and make a decision: is it worth it? Is the right thing to do to toil and try to improve the lives of other people when you may never be thanked? To risk it never being picked up by others and used at all?</p>
