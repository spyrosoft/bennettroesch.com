          <p>One of the most common types of innovation today is the combination and modification of different solved ideas into a brand new idea. This happens when large chunks of knowledge from a specialist is transferred to others. As of right now, there is no formal training built into the education system (or any other system for that matter) that helps people build this skill. At the moment, it is a chaos driven sink or swim situation and everyone is left to figure it out on their own, if at all. The solutions to this are similar to learning how to learn. Teaching people how to teach allows information to travel much farther and in a deeper and more complete way.</p>
