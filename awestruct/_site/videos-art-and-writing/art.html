          I occasionally create pendants by weaving braided steel wire or etching a drawing from red painted aluminum.

          I've been a Lego nut for some time. Here are some of the creations I have made over the years. My favorite is probably my mystery box, the rectangular box with three red pieces on the bottom.

          In high school I took sculpture and craft design classes. These are some of the works I made.

        <p>
          In high school (Uh Eenuh Oozhay) I took Computer Art Graphics with Mr. Tucci. It was one of the best classes I've ever taken. Tucci was incredible. The software is incredible. I spent more time in that class than any other classes in the morning put together. Actually, the only other class I had in the morning was media. Anyway, I put a lot of work into it. Enjoy.

          This was my desktop wallpaper for a long time. Believe it or not, I made that with Paint. Never again.
