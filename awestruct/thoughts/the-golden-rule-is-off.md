The golden rule:

> Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.

Treating people the way they want to be treated is often counterintuitively different from the way you would like to be treated. People are very, very different from one another in fundamental ways. Especially the farther apart people are in culture, gender, beliefs, etc. Taking the time to be sensitive to these differences goes a long way:

> Do unto others as they would have you do unto them.
